    <p>
  Based on the comprehensive analysis of your academic performance, logical and verbal reasoning abilities, creativity, and other personality indicators, we’ve computed weighted scores for four primary academic streams: Medical Science, Non-Medical Science, Commerce, and Arts.
</p>

<p>
  Each stream score was calculated using a standardized formula that prioritizes subject-specific strengths and essential soft skills required in that field. These weights reflect the real-world demands and skillsets typically associated with each stream.
</p>

<p>
  After processing your responses and scores, we are pleased to recommend the following streams as the best fit for your profile:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1. {{ prediction_label }}</strong> – This stream is most aligned with your overall profile, showcasing strong potential in both subject matter relevance and personal aptitude.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These recommendations are tailored to help you make well-informed academic decisions based on both your capabilities and interests. We encourage you to explore career options within these streams further and continue to build on your strengths for future academic and professional success.
